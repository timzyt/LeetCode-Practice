Tree recursive problem

We can create a temporary variable and return it in a recursive function

When we return it everytime this one will be useful

Recursive function is the depth-first traverse, we don't have to worry about the 
order

we can use !node->left && node->right to judge whether left node is empty and do
some jobs
