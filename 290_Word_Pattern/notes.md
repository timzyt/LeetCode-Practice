We use two maps and traverse them in order. When we meet both elements in two maps which haven't been given value, we set the same value for them. 
In this way, they are paired within two maps
Then we go to the next element, if one of them is given number, return false, if both of them are given number, compare the value
In the same time, we have to consider the size of pattern and the word number in the other string
