tree problem

We have to pay attentiont to the specific example

like only have one tree branch

first we have to find every nodes' maximum depth and compare left and right nodes

return the result for judgement

we may seperate it with different functions

When you return bool, if you have null node you return true, you don't have to 
care about return false option
Because there is an option which can determine the final result when there are 
so many judgement linked &&
